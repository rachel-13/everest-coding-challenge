# Everest Coding Challenge: Package Delivery

This README serves as a documentation of the thought process taken while setting up and developing this flow.


## Starting out

There were several options to kick start this project and since using Swift to develop a command line tool is a rare scenario, documentation on the idea has been limited but it boils down to the following options:

1. Creating an executable using Swift Package Manager according to this [Swift document](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/cli-swiftpm/). 
2. Use the conventional way of XCode Project to create a MacOS Command Line Tool

After a few trials and errors, I ended up using option #2 as this was the only way I was able to get a unit test target running in order to follow TDD practices.

## Problem 1
